When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I work with other people or when I work from different coomputers or places and don't want to carry any hardware with me.

automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Commits are very small steps, usally I want a bigger step, containing a lot of small steps, be finished before showing it to others.
